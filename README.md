# Stochastic Differential Equations for Temperature Prediction

Welcome to our project repository where we use Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) to predict temperatures. This project focuses on leveraging linear SDEs with functional tendencies and solving them with numerical methods for stochastic integration.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into the following folders and files:

### Main Directory
- **Notebook**: Contains the Jupyter Notebook with the implementation code for solving the SDEs and predicting temperatures.

### Literature
- **Reference Papers**: This folder includes all the reference papers and literature that provide the theoretical background and methodologies used in the project.

### Data
- **Temperature Data**: This folder contains the datasets used for training and validating the SDE models.

## Key Features

- **Linear SDEs with Functional Tendency**: Implements linear stochastic differential equations with functional trends to model and predict temperature variations.
- **Numerical Methods for Stochastic Integration**: Utilizes advanced numerical methods to solve the SDEs accurately.
- **Comprehensive Literature**: Provides access to essential reference papers for deeper understanding and further research.
